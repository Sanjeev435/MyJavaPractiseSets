# Patterns Information
24 Gang of Four design patterns, as listed in the book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software. Each pattern includes class diagrams, explanation, usage information, and a real world example.

#### Creational Patterns: 
Used to construct objects such that they can be decoupled from their implementing system.

#### Structural Patterns: 
Used to form large object structures between many disparate objects.

#### Behavioral Patterns: 
Used to manage algorithms, relationships, and responsibilities between objects.

#### Object Scope: 
Deals with object relationships that can be changed at runtime.

#### Class Scope: 
Deals with class relationships that can be changed at compile time.
